# User Stories

### As a user, I want to:

+ *See an interesting mashup of different data.*
+ *Input information to change the displayed result.*
+ *View the app on all of my devices.*

### Stretch stories: 

+ *As an impatient user, I want to see some indication that data is loading.*
+ *As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong.*

### Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Query at least two APIs using fetch.
- [x] Dynamic content generated with JS.
- [x] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme.
- [x] A responsive, mobile-first design.
- [x] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible.

# Planning:
#### During the planning phase we suggest you spend time on:

##### *Exploring APIs you are interested in working with*
##### *Considering your user journey*
##### *Deciding what you need to build for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and splitting up the tasks*
##### *API keys* 
##### *Some APIs require a key or token so they can identify who is making a request. This allows them to block people who abuse the API (or charge people if it’s not a free service).*

# Choosing your APIs 
#### Things to check before you start: 
##### *Does it support CORS (cross-origin requests)?*
##### *Is there a high enough rate limit?*
##### *Is a free API key available?*
##### *Are you able to use the API without user authentication (OAuth)?*
##### *Is good documentation available?*

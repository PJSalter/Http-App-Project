## Planned Diagram of project:

## Initial theme ideas:

As a group we planned the project collectively and picked themes that related to the two API's we chose. We really enjoyed the idea of blending themes of the Big Bang Theory and Star Wars.

We chose a font that was consistent which was a reminder of Star Wars intro font with root colour yellow.

# User Stories

- [x] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible.

# Planning:
#### During the planning phase we suggest you spend time on:

##### *We explored as a group what API's we found interesting*
##### *Considering your user journey*
##### *Deciding what you need to build for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and splitting up the tasks*
##### *API keys* 
##### *Some APIs require a key or token so they can identify who is making a request. This allows them to block people who abuse the API (or charge people if it’s not a free service).*

# Choosing your APIs 
#### Things to check before you start: 
##### *Does it support CORS (cross-origin requests)?*
##### *Is there a high enough rate limit?*
##### *Is a free API key available?*
##### *Are you able to use the API without user authentication (OAuth)?*
##### *Is good documentation available?*
